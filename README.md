## ðŸ§  How the Program Works (Step-by-Step)

The logic in `main.py` follows these steps:

1. **Input**:  
   Prompts the user to enter two names.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Removes spaces and converts both names to lowercase for consistency.

3. **Letter Cancellation**:
   - Counts and cancels out common letters between the two names.
   - The remaining number of characters is used to determine the relationship.

4. **FLAMES Logic**:
   - Iteratively removes letters from the word "FLAMES" using the count of unmatched letters.
   - The process continues until only one letter remains.

5. **Result**:
   - The final letter corresponds to a relationship type, which is then displayed to the user.
